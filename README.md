# 📚 Welcome to My Python Learning Journey!

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub. This repository is dedicated to my ongoing practice of **Python programming** and my passion for **Machine Learning (ML)**.

## 🚀 About Me

My name is Joseph (he/him). I'm currently focused on improving my skills in Python and gradually exploring the vast field of **Machine Learning**. My goal is to build projects that not only enhance my coding abilities but also lay the groundwork for building intelligent systems in the future.

Random fact about me: I love frogs!
